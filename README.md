# wobtrack
A rails application to caculate and display speed, distance, height and other parameters from gpx tracks.

Bycycling with a gps logging device you will gpx tracks with some geolocation information 
(latitude, longitude, height), a timestamp and may be vital parameters (i.e. pulse rate).
wobtrack reads gpx tracks from file, calculates speed and distance and displays a simple graph.
Since I am cycling in a rolling countryside i am interested in parameters like potential energy (Joule), 
power (Watt), summary height and the gradient of the path.

wobtrack may later be extended to show track on a map like openstreetmap, but this is not the primary goal.

THIS APPLICATION IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT READY FOR USAGE YET.
